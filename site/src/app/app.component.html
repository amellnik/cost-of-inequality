          <h1>The cost of rising inequality</h1>
          <p>
            You probably already know that inequality in America is rising, and that much of the economic gains of the
            past four decades have gone to the very wealthy. (If you don't, see <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/10/opinion/coronavirus-us-economy-inequality.html">David
              Leonhardt and Yaryna Serkez's excellent article in the Times</a>).

            But what does that mean for you? Enter your post-tax annual income below to find out.

            You are in the top {{formattedPercentile()}} of all Americans by income.

          <p>
            The plot below shows how you fare compared to other Americans. The left axis is
            post-tax income (in 2014 USD) and the bottom axis show the percentile of income.
          </p>
          <p>
            This plot is difficult to read since the lowest 99% of Americans make so much less
            than the extremely rich. We can make this easier by making it a log-log plot.

            Plotting the distribution of income on a log-log plot makes it easier to see what's
            going on with the extremely rich, but 70% of Americans are now squished into the first
            column of the plot.
